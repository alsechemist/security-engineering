Testing → Windows Agent
=======================

.. note::

    Replace ``[username]``, ``[path/to/wordlist]`` and ``[ip-of-linux-machine]`` according to your preferences.
    You can skip the ``-I`` option if no previous sessions are saved.

Copy and paste the below command on your attacking machine.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo hydra -t 4 -l [username] -P [path/to/wordlist] [ip-of-linux-machine] rdp -v -I

An image has been attached below for demonstration.

Now back to our Wazuh Dashboard, we should be seeing the related logs are being generated.

Now run the workflow that we have created on Tracecat

You should notice that, the active response component executed. Checking the result section will show further details.

Checking back on our Wazuh Dashboard, we should notice that an event appeared showing ``Active response: active-response/bin/netsh - add`` on that
specific Agent,as shown in the below image.

Checking on the attacker side, after some time, we will see errors, as shown below.

This settles that, our setup is functional and working.

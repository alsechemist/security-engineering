About Me
--------

I am a Security Engineer driven by the pursuit of building resilient, secure, and adaptive digital systems.
My work revolves around designing, implementing, and hardening security infrastructures — blending technical precision with
the creativity of alchemy to turn complex challenges into structured defenses.

Through Alsechemist, I document my journey across the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity — from deep-dive research and
real-world implementations to experimental projects and defense engineering methodologies.

This space reflects my belief that true cybersecurity is not just about protection — it is about transformation, understanding, and continuous evolution.

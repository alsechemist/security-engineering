What is Tracecat?
=================
Tracecat represents the next generation of Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms. 
While traditional SOAR solutions often require extensive customization and complex licensing, 
Tracecat provides an intuitive, workflow-driven approach to security automation that democratizes advanced threat response capabilities.
Imagine Tracecat as an intelligent conductor orchestrating a symphony of security tools. 
It excels at connecting disparate security systems, creating automated workflows that can investigate alerts, 
enrich threat intelligence, and execute complex response procedures without human intervention. 
Tracecat's strength lies in its ability to standardize and streamline security operations, 
reducing the mean time to response and ensuring consistent handling of security incidents.

Introduction
============

In today's cybersecurity landscape, organizations need robust solutions that can both detect threats and respond to them automatically. 
This integration brings together two powerful open-source platforms that complement each other perfectly. 
**Wazuh** for comprehensive security monitoring and **Tracecat** for intelligent security orchestration.

This Project assumes that you have already setup **Wazuh** and **Tracecat** in respective environment. Besides, if you don't want to go through too many details,
you can just have your ``Quick Start`` by referring to the :doc:`configuration-of-servers` section of the documentation.
